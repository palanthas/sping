I created this for fun. I needed to ping a computer that may or may not be up and if it wasn't then I didn't know when it would be turned on next. I just wanted a little warning sound when I got a response.

The sonar.wav file I used was downloaded from https://freesound.org/people/KIZILSUNGUR/sounds/70299/ which is licensed under the Creative Commons 0 License.

Feel free to use this script in any way you want. It was created and intended to run on a linux machine. Your results may vary. It is available AS-IS.
